# KAIROS System Architecture Overview

## System Components

### 1. Central Orchestrator System (CORE)
The brain of KAIROS that manages all simulation aspects:

- **Input Analyzer**: Processes initial user prompt, determines simulation type and requirements
- **Scenario Designer**: Defines simulation parameters, timeline, and objectives
- **Simulation Manager**: Oversees entire process, detects deviations, intervenes when necessary
- **Results Synthesizer**: Extracts key insights and generates final reports

### 2. Agent Factory (FORGE)
Responsible for creating and configuring AI agents:

- **Personality Constructor**: Configures cognitive profiles, personalities, and roles
- **Knowledge Assigner**: Equips each agent with specific domains and perspectives
- **Cognitive Modeler**: Defines reasoning patterns, biases, and communication styles
- **Divergence Module**: Generates atypical and synthetic neurodivergent thinking modes

### 3. Simulation Engine (ENGINE)
Powers the interactive simulation environment:

- **Conversation Manager**: Coordinates turns, interventions, and interaction flows
- **Shared Memory System**: Maintains global context and knowledge accessible to all agents
- **Emergence Module**: Identifies and amplifies unexpected connections and emerging patterns
- **Stimulus Injector**: Introduces elements to maintain dynamism and avoid stagnation

### 4. Analysis and Synthesis System (LENS)
Processes and extracts value from simulations:

- **Concept Extractor**: Identifies key and novel ideas generated in simulation
- **Pattern Analyzer**: Detects emergent thought structures
- **Connection Visualizer**: Generates concept maps and relationship diagrams
- **Report Generator**: Produces executive summaries, transcripts, and detailed analyses
