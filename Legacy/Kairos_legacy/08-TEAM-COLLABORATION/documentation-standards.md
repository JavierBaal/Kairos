# Documentation Standards for KAIROS Project

## Overview

This document outlines the documentation standards for the KAIROS project, ensuring consistent, high-quality, and maintainable documentation across all project components.

## Core Principles

1. **"Culture of Writing"**
   - Documentation is a first-class deliverable
   - All significant decisions and implementations must be documented
   - Documentation evolves alongside code

2. **"No Orphan Knowledge"**
   - Critical knowledge must never reside with a single person
   - Regular knowledge sharing sessions are mandatory
   - Cross-training through pair programming and rotation

3. **"Context, not just Content"**
   - Document the "why" behind decisions
   - Include considered alternatives
   - Preserve historical context

4. **"Continuous Documentation"**
   - Update docs simultaneously with code changes
   - Regular documentation reviews
   - Automated documentation checks in CI/CD

## Documentation Types

### 1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Title and Status
- Context and Problem Statement
- Decision Drivers
- Considered Options
- Decision Outcome
- Consequences and Trade-offs
- Implementation Notes

### 2. Technical Documentation
- System Architecture
- Component Specifications
- API Documentation
- Integration Guides
- Performance Considerations
- Security Requirements

### 3. Code Documentation
- Clear and Consistent Comments
- Function/Method Documentation
- Module/Class Documentation
- Example Usage
- Edge Cases and Limitations
- Performance Implications

### 4. Process Documentation
- Development Workflows
- Testing Procedures
- Deployment Processes
- Monitoring and Maintenance
- Incident Response
- Security Protocols

## Documentation Structure

### Repository Organization
```
/docs
├── architecture/       # Architecture documentation
├── technical/         # Technical specifications
├── api/              # API documentation
├── processes/        # Process documentation
└── decisions/        # Architecture Decision Records
```

### Document Templates

#### Technical Document Template
```markdown
# Component Name

## Overview
[Brief description]

## Purpose
[Why this component exists]

## Technical Specifications
[Detailed technical information]

## Dependencies
[External dependencies]

## Usage
[How to use/implement]

## Considerations
[Important notes, limitations]
```

#### ADR Template
```markdown
# Title

## Status
[Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change]
```

## Writing Guidelines

### 1. General Principles
- Use clear, concise language
- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Include relevant examples
- Link to related documents
- Version control documentation with code

### 2. Code Comments
- Explain why, not what
- Document non-obvious decisions
- Include usage examples
- Note performance implications
- Document edge cases

### 3. Technical Writing
- Use consistent terminology
- Include diagrams where helpful
- Provide context for decisions
- Link to external references
- Keep audience in mind
